### 🚀 **Featured Projects**  
**Single-Phase Inverter Control System**
- Designed a highly efficient single phase inverter with load current feedforward control in PSIM.
-  Utilized sine wave graphs to represent the periodic behavior of output voltage and current, aiding in parameter analysis
and waveform quality assessment. Simulation results demonstrated that the load current feedforward control system
maintained a THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) of 2.68%, well within the 5% limit.
- The power factor, a key indicator of inverter efficiency, was maintained at 0.93 with an inductive load in the simulations,
meeting expectations.
- The voltage reference was 311V and the output voltage is 315V. The system achieved a power factor of 94%.

**Performance and Analysis of a Solar Wind Hybrid Power System** | Current Project
- Currently working on performance and analysis of Wind-Pv Hybrid sytem in matlab and simulink.
- Its has a pv system , wind system ,energy storage system,3-phase inverter with an lc filter,load, max power point tracking by incremental conductance method + intergral regulator.
